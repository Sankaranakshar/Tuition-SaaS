# ClassStackr — Engineering Handoff

_Last updated: 2026-07-07. Author: Stage 0 execution pass._

This document lets anyone (engineer or agent) pick up the build without re-reading the whole history. It records exactly what is done, what is verified, what is blocked on you, and what comes next.

**Read order for a newcomer:** this file → [DEV_PLAN.md](DEV_PLAN.md) (the executable plan) → [GO_TO_MARKET_BLUEPRINT.md](GO_TO_MARKET_BLUEPRINT.md) (why) → [REDESIGN.md](REDESIGN.md) (product experience). Then `firestore.rules` and `tests/rules/rbac.test.ts`.

---

## 1. Current state in one paragraph

The repository is a fresh, safe foundation. **Stage 0 of DEV_PLAN.md is complete** (Epics 1–5: security, server money, SQLite removal, query hygiene, and the full design foundation — tokens, shell, palette, component kit, and i18n wrapper), and **Stage 1 Epic 6 (Payments) is built server-side** (Razorpay payment links, signature-verified idempotent webhooks, reconciliation poll, gap-free invoice numbering, tax/GST snapshot, manual refunds). The four Critical security vulnerabilities (C1–C5) are fixed in `firestore.rules` and codified as an executable test suite. SQLite is gone; the app runs on Firestore + a slim stateless Express API. Money and attendance are server-authoritative. The product builds, typechecks, unit-tests green (18/18), and boots with all routes wired. It has **not** been deployed to a live Firebase project and the payment loop has **not** been run end-to-end (needs a live/emulated Firebase project + a connected Razorpay account). No WhatsApp/email delivery yet (Epic 7). Commits through Epic 5 are on GitHub `main`; Epic 6 is uncommitted in the working tree.

---

## 2. Repository & git state

- **Remote:** `git@github.com:Sankaranakshar/Tuition-SaaS.git` (private), branch `main`, upstream tracking set.
- **History (3 commits):**
  1. `96865ce` Baseline — code as received + planning docs
  2. `0fb8d01` Stage 0 — security, server money, SQLite removal
  3. `7c98726` Epic 5 (partial) — tokens, shell, palette
- **⚠️ History note:** the build started from a fresh `git init`, so `main`'s previous AI-Studio commit history (~10 commits) was replaced by this clean 3-commit history. **No code was lost** — commit 1 is byte-identical to the old remote HEAD plus the planning docs. The old commits likely still exist as unreferenced objects on GitHub for now; ask if you want them grafted back onto a `legacy-history` branch.

## 3. What was done, by epic (with file pointers)

### Epic 1 — Repo, environments, CI
- `git init` + baseline commit; pushed to GitHub with upstream tracking.
- Package renamed `react-example` → `classstackr`, v0.1.0 ([package.json](package.json)).
- Removed dead/vulnerable deps: `bcryptjs`, `@google/genai`, `xlsx` (CVEs) → `exceljs`, plus `cookie-parser`, `multer`, `better-sqlite3` once their code was deleted.
- Deleted the duplicate `/components/ui` tree (kept `src/components/ui`).
- CI: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — typecheck → unit tests → **Firestore rules tests on emulator** → build.
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) — stateless, multi-stage, non-root, Cloud Run-ready.
- [firebase.json](firebase.json) — emulator config (auth 9099, firestore 8080, storage 9199, UI 4000).
- [firestore.indexes.json](firestore.indexes.json) — composite indexes for sessions, invoices, attendance, enrollments, wallet_ledger.

### Epic 2 — Security rewrite (fixes C1–C5)
- [firestore.rules](firestore.rules) fully rewritten, role-aware, matching the RBAC matrix in GO_TO_MARKET_BLUEPRINT.md §9.3.
  - **C1** (privilege escalation): `users` doc update restricted to profile fields; `role`/`organizationId`/`roles` can never be self-assigned. Membership is server-written only.
  - **C2** (client-writable money): `invoices`, `payments`, `wallets`, `wallet_ledger`, `transactions`, `billing_events`, `attendance_records` deny **all** client writes.
  - **C3** (flat privilege): granular roles (owner/admin/tutor/frontdesk/accountant/parent/student) per collection.
  - **C4** (message privacy): `conversations`/`messages` readable only by `participantIds`.
  - **C5** (cross-tenant leak): `tutor_profiles` org-scoped; FindTutors marketplace deleted.
- **The executable constitution:** [tests/rules/rbac.test.ts](tests/rules/rbac.test.ts) — 34 tests, one+ per matrix cell plus explicit C1–C5 regressions. _Any change to `firestore.rules` or a privileged endpoint must keep this green._
- Auth middleware ([server/middleware/auth.ts](server/middleware/auth.ts)): trusts Firebase **custom claims only**, header bearer tokens only (cookie path removed → no CSRF surface), `checkRevoked` so removed members lose access immediately.
- Crypto ([server/utils/crypto.ts](server/utils/crypto.ts)): `v1:` key-version prefix for future rotation; honest error message.
- [storage.rules](storage.rules) — org-isolated file access mirroring Firestore, 5MB cap, MIME allowlist, student submission folders.

### Epic 3 — One data model, server-authoritative money
- **SQLite fully removed.** Express is stateless. Deleted `server/db.ts` and the SQLite-backed routes.
- Google refresh tokens → server-only `google_tokens` collection, AES-256-GCM ([server/routes/settings.ts](server/routes/settings.ts)).
- **New privileged API** ([server/routes/billing.ts](server/routes/billing.ts)):
  - `POST /api/v1/billing/attendance` — **persists attendance_records** (previously never saved) and settles wallet debit / invoice accrual in one **idempotent** Firestore transaction. Idempotency key = `sessionId_studentId`. 7-day backdating window, future sessions blocked, tutors limited to own sessions.
  - `POST /api/v1/billing/payments/manual` — idempotency-keyed, paise integer math, partial-payment aware.
  - `POST /api/v1/billing/invoices/:id/void` — invoices are voided, never deleted.
  - `POST /api/v1/billing/sessions/cancel`.
- **Membership API** ([server/routes/members.ts](server/routes/members.ts)): `bootstrap` (create org + owner claims atomically), `PUT` set role, `DELETE` remove member — all set custom claims and revoke tokens.
- **Audit trail** ([server/utils/audit.ts](server/utils/audit.ts)): every privileged mutation writes an append-only `audit_events` doc.
- Client `ClassManager.markAttendance` deleted; frontend now calls the API via [src/lib/api.ts](src/lib/api.ts).
- Fake `meet.google.com/placeholder-…` links removed (real links come in Epic 8).
- Conflict queries bounded by org + 12h window (were unbounded, growing forever).
- Recurring generation returns `skipped[]` conflicts instead of silently swallowing them; surfaced to the user as a toast in [src/pages/Calendar.tsx](src/pages/Calendar.tsx).

### Epic 4 — Query hygiene & error honesty
- Dashboard listeners bounded ([src/pages/Dashboard.tsx](src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)): rolling session window, 12-month invoices, capped assessments (were four unbounded `onSnapshot`s).
- **All `alert()` / `window.confirm()` removed** (Calendar, Leads, Contact) → `sonner` toasts with undo. Lead delete is now optimistic + 5-second undo.
- INR everywhere via [src/lib/format.ts](src/lib/format.ts) (`formatINR`, `formatPaise`, Indian digit grouping, relative dates). Every `$` render purged.
- `exceljs` loaded dynamically (out of main bundle).
- Server: structured JSON errors, JSON 404 for unknown API routes, graceful shutdown, per-user rate limiting, `/api/v1` prefix.

### Epic 5 — Design foundation & shell (COMPLETE)
- **Tokens & shell:** design tokens in [src/index.css](src/index.css) (slate base, single indigo accent, semantic colors, dark variants, `tabular-nums`). [Layout.tsx](src/components/Layout.tsx) rewritten as the 56px icon rail (5 workspaces + settings; student nav 11→5 items). [CommandPalette.tsx](src/components/CommandPalette.tsx) (cmdk): `Cmd+K` nav, create actions, org-scoped student jump. The fake search box is now a real palette trigger. Page title fixed (was "My Google AI Studio App").
- **Component kit** ([src/components/kit/](src/components/kit)): `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`/`SkeletonText`/`SkeletonRow`/`SkeletonCard`, `StatChip`, `StatusChip`, `AgedBadge` (escalating temperature by days overdue), `PersonRow` (the shared People row schema), `ContextCard` (Inbox anchor), `CapacityMeter`, `Popover` + `PopoverEdit` (the dependency-free inline-edit primitive). All token-driven, colour-never-sole-signal. Barrel export in [src/components/kit/index.ts](src/components/kit/index.ts).
- **Demo route** ([src/pages/Kit.tsx](src/pages/Kit.tsx)): every kit component in every state, at `/app/kit` and via the palette ("Component kit"). This is the E5.4 acceptance artifact.
- **i18n wrapper** ([src/lib/i18n.ts](src/lib/i18n.ts) + [src/locales/en.json](src/locales/en.json)): react-i18next initialised in [main.tsx](src/main.tsx), English-only at launch. Shell strings (rail labels, search, logout, settings, notifications, switch-portal) now go through `t()`; new surfaces must too.
- **Note on types:** this repo has **no `@types/react`** installed — JSX is loosely typed and `key` on a custom component or the `React.*` namespace will not compile. Use intrinsic-element keys and `import { type ReactNode } from "react"` (see the kit for the pattern). Do not add `@types/react` casually; it strict-types all legacy JSX at once.

### Epic 6 — Payments / Razorpay (Stage 1, BUILT, not e2e-verified)
The money loop's server backbone. Each org connects **its own** Razorpay account so fees land in the center's bank, not ours; keys are AES-GCM-encrypted in the server-only `payment_gateways` collection (mirrors `google_tokens`).
- **Pure, unit-tested core** (`npm test`, 12 new cases): [server/utils/invoiceStatus.ts](server/utils/invoiceStatus.ts) (the invoice status machine `applyPayment` — caps paid at total, reports overpayment, refuses void/paid, integer-paise only; **shared by the manual-payment route and the webhook** so both settle identically), [server/utils/invoiceNumber.ts](server/utils/invoiceNumber.ts) (`INV-{ORG}-{YYYY}-{seq}` + transactional counter), [server/utils/razorpay.ts](server/utils/razorpay.ts) (`verifyWebhookSignature` HMAC timing-safe, `createPaymentLink`, `fetchPaymentLink`, per-org creds).
- **Billing endpoints** ([server/routes/billing.ts](server/routes/billing.ts)): `POST /invoices/:id/finalize` (assign number + GST snapshot, idempotent), `POST /invoices/:id/payment-link` (create/reuse Razorpay UPI link for the outstanding amount), `POST /refunds` (idempotency-keyed, audited), `POST /reconcile` (hourly poll for missed webhooks, idempotent by link id).
- **Webhook receiver** ([server/routes/webhooks.ts](server/routes/webhooks.ts)): `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay/:orgId`, mounted with a **raw body parser before JSON + rate limiting** (see server.ts). Verifies the org's webhook secret, then settles idempotently by gateway payment id (`payments/rzp_<id>`); overpayment becomes wallet-ledger credit.
- **Gateway settings** ([server/routes/gateway.ts](server/routes/gateway.ts)): `GET /api/v1/gateway`, `PUT/DELETE /gateway/razorpay`, `PUT /gateway/tax`. Secrets are write-only from the client's perspective — never returned.
- **Client API** ([src/lib/api.ts](src/lib/api.ts)): `finalizeInvoice`, `createInvoicePaymentLink`, `refundPayment`, `reconcilePayments`, `voidInvoice`, `getGatewaySettings`, `connectRazorpay`, `disconnectRazorpay`, `saveTaxSettings`.
- **Rules regressions** added to [tests/rules/rbac.test.ts](tests/rules/rbac.test.ts): clients (even the owner) cannot read/write `payment_gateways`, `counters`, or `refunds` (default-deny; run in CI).
- **Not done in Epic 6:** UI surfaces (the Money workspace that calls these is Epic 12 / Stage 2; wire buttons onto the legacy Invoices page sooner if a pilot needs it), server-side PDF receipt (E6.5 — deps `jspdf`/`jspdf-autotable` are present, endpoint not written yet), and initiating gateway refunds via Razorpay API (E6.6 records the ledger side only; refund is issued from the Razorpay dashboard for now).

## 4. How to run, test, deploy

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill Firebase + Google OAuth + secrets
npm run dev                    # Express + Vite (PORT env respected, default 3000)

npm run lint                   # tsc --noEmit
npm test                       # unit tests (format/money math) — 6 passing
npm run test:rules             # Firestore rules suite — REQUIRES Java + firebase-tools
npm run build                  # vite build + esbuild server bundle
```

**Secrets:** generate `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Production → Google Secret Manager, never a file.

**Deploy rules/indexes:** `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage`.

## 5. Verification status

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` (typecheck) | ✅ clean |
| `npm run build` | ✅ passes (server bundle 24.5kb; SPA route-split) |
| `npm test` (unit) | ✅ 18/18 (money math, invoice numbering, webhook signature) |
| Server boots with Epic 6 routes, `/api/health` ok | ✅ verified on :3199 |
| Unauth billing / gateway calls rejected | ✅ structured 401 JSON before any Firestore touch |
| Payment webhook / reconcile e2e | ⚠️ **not run** — needs live/emulated Firestore + a connected Razorpay account |
| Unknown API route → JSON 404 | ✅ |
| `npm run test:rules` | ⚠️ **NOT run locally** — this machine has no Java. Written to run in CI. **First action for whoever has Java: run it and confirm 34/34 green.** |
| Browser UI walkthrough | ⚠️ not done — needs a live/emulated Firebase project with seeded data |

---

## 6. Blocked on you (cannot be done from a dev machine)

1. **Firebase projects** for `dev`/`staging`/`prod` (separate projects), then `firebase deploy` the new rules. **The currently-live rules still contain C1–C5.** Deploying the new rules is the single most urgent real-world action.
2. **Existing-user migration:** users created before this change have **no custom claims**. After deploy, each org owner must pass through `POST /api/v1/members/bootstrap` once (or run a one-off backfill script — ask and I'll write it). Until then they won't resolve an `organizationId`.
3. **Stage 1 long-lead items** (start now, they take weeks): Razorpay live KYC, WhatsApp Business API onboarding + template approval, SMS DLT registration, CA review of GST invoice format, privacy policy + ToS.
4. Confirm CI is green on GitHub Actions (needs the repo's Actions enabled; the workflow provisions Java itself).
5. **Wire the Epic 6 payment loop to real infrastructure** (cannot be finished from a dev machine): per pilot org, connect its Razorpay keys via `PUT /api/v1/gateway/razorpay` (key id + secret + webhook secret); in the Razorpay dashboard, register the webhook URL `${APP_URL}/api/webhooks/razorpay/{orgId}` for the `payment_link.paid` and `payment.captured` events using that same webhook secret; schedule the reconciliation poll (Cloud Scheduler → authenticated `POST /api/v1/billing/reconcile` hourly). Then run the wedge demo end-to-end on staging with a real ₹ payment.

---

## 7. Next steps (in order)

1. **Run `npm run test:rules` on a Java-equipped machine / CI**; fix any red before anything else. This suite is the safety net for all future rules work.
2. ~~Finish Epic 5~~ **done** (kit + i18n + shell). Remaining Epic 5 polish that is deferred into the workspace rebuilds (Stage 1–3): restyling the *legacy* pages to tokens happens when each is retired per DEV_PLAN §"Delete on replace", not in place.
3. **Stage 1, Epic 6 (Payments):** Razorpay links + webhooks + reconciliation ([DEV_PLAN.md](DEV_PLAN.md) §Stage 1). Do this on the new `payments`/`invoices` shapes already defined.
4. **Epic 7 (WhatsApp/email router), Epic 8 (real Meet links), Epic 9 (Today workspace + one-tap attendance — the API it calls already exists), Epic 10 (parent portal + pay).**
5. Stage 1 exit gate: the wedge demo — mark attendance → invoice → WhatsApp UPI link → real payment → self-reconciled ledger, in one take.

---

## 8. Security invariants — do not regress

1. Roles set **only** via `/api/v1/members` (claims + membership doc, tokens revoked on change).
2. Money mutations **only** via `/api/v1/billing`, idempotency-keyed, each writing an `audit_events` record.
3. Attendance = one Firestore transaction covering attendance records + wallet debit + invoice accrual.
4. Amounts are **integer paise** in new fields (`totalPaise`, `paidPaise`, `subtotalPaise`); rupee floats are legacy display only.
5. `google_tokens` and `audit_events` have **no** client access path. `firestore.rules` default-denies unmatched collections — keep it that way.
6. Never fabricate meeting links, invoice numbers, or payment confirmations client-side.
7. Gateway secrets (`payment_gateways`) are AES-GCM-encrypted, server-only, and never returned to the client — the API exposes connection state and the public key id only.
8. Every inbound webhook is HMAC-signature-verified against the org's stored secret **before** its body is trusted, and settled idempotently by gateway payment id. The raw-body mount in `server.ts` (before JSON parsing) is load-bearing for this — do not reorder it.

---

## 9. Known tech debt carried forward (tracked, not yet addressed)

- Old pages (StudentProfile 1,289 lines, Calendar, Students, Invoices) still exist and function but are slated for rebuild in Stages 2–3 (REDESIGN.md). They work inside the new shell but are not token-styled.
- Legacy rupee fields coexist with new paise fields on invoices/wallets during migration; a cleanup pass removes the floats once all readers use paise.
- No Sentry wired yet (Epic 1 listed it; add DSN when you have one).
- Data migration script for Timestamp-vs-ISO-string on existing session docs not yet written (new writes are fine).
